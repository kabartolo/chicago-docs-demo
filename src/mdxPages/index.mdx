### Styling

Many reusable styles are defined using <a href="theme-ui.com">Theme-UI</a>. The site layout is styled mainly using <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules/">CSS modules</a> and <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>. All styles can be customized through <a href="/docs/styling-and-shadowing/">shadowing</a>.

All components include regular class names, so you can customize the site using plain CSS if you prefer.

### Components

A mark of good reference documentation is how easy it is to **skim** for the information a user needs. Docs in this theme are written in <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a>, and the theme comes with several <a href="/docs/API/component-api/">components</a> that help present your docs in a way that makes them easy to scan. These are used throughout this demo, and the <a href="/docs/example-api-doc/">Example API Doc</a> offers a complete demonstration.
