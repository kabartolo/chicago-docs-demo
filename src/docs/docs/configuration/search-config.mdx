## Overview

This theme comes with a docs search that is designed for small sites. If your documentation is extensive, you might find an <a href="#using-algolia-or-another-search-interface">alternative search library</a> works better for your project.

## How the Theme Search Works

During the build process, an index of paragraphs and headers is created for each post. These data, along with the post's title and description, are used by [`gatsby-plugin-elasticlunr-search`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/@gatsby-contrib/gatsby-plugin-elasticlunr-search/) to build a search index for the site. This index can be fetched using the GraphQL query `allSiteSearchIndex`.

Only posts living in `src/docs` (or the `docsPath` set in the <a href="/docs/configuration/site-options/#theme-options">theme options</a>) are indexed.

As a user inputs a search query, this search index is crawled for a match of the **exact** search query. Matches are ordered based on the following boost values:

<CodeExample title="Search/index.js" labels={['JavaScript']}>

```js
searchIndex.search(query, {
  fields: {
    title: { boost: 3 },
    description: { boost: 2 },
    headers: { boost: 2 },
    paragraphs: { boost: 1 },
  },
});
```

</CodeExample>

If <a href="/docs/configuration/site-options/#theme-options">`primaryResultsOnly`</a> is set to `true`, matches in the title, description, and/or headers are presented, but no paragraph matches are included.

For a demonstration, try searching for 'mdx' in the demo site.

## Using Algolia or Another Search Interface

There are faster and more robust solutions to documentation search out there. I recommend <a href="https://docsearch.algolia.com/">DocSearch by Algolia</a>, which is **free** for docs sites.

To use a different search interface, 

1. Set `allowDocsSearch` to false in the `gatsby-config.js` theme options. This prevents the theme from fully populating the search index and from showing the theme searchbar.

2. <a href="/docs/styling-and-shadowing/#component-example">Shadow</a> the Search component to create one that works with your custom library. For example, <a href="https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/dropdown/">Algolia</a> provides functions and components to display its search results.

3. Shadow the component (e.g., Header) that will display the custom Search component.
