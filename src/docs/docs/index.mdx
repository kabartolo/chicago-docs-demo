## A Modern Docs Theme for Gatsby

**MDX \| Theme-UI** \| **Custom Components**

The Chicago Docs theme for <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby</a> is a modern and professional docs site for small open source projects. It was designed by <a href="https://kabartolo.com">a technical writer</a> (that's me!) to be readable, easy to navigate, and accessible.

The theme includes

* <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a>
* <a href="https://theme-ui.com/">Theme-UI</a>
* <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules/">CSS modules</a>
* <a href="https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/">Typography.js</a>
* Code highlighting with <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer">`prism-react-renderer`</a>
* Dark and light modes
* Code blocks with live preview, line numbers, and line highlighting, as well as title, copy button, and language selection
* Several other <a href="/docs/components-and-hooks/">components</a> for displaying your docs, such as a property table

The site's colors and more decorative styling use <a href="theme-ui.com">Theme-UI</a>. Other styles such as margins and spacing use <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules/">CSS modules</a> and <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> for a complete and functional site. All styles can be customized through <a href="/docs/styling-and-shadowing/">shadowing</a>. All components have regular class names, so you can also use plain CSS if you prefer.

A mark of good reference documentation is how easy it is to **skim** for the information a user needs. Docs in this theme are written in <a href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</a>, and the theme comes with several <a href="/docs/API/component-api/">components</a> that help present your docs in a way that makes them easy to scan. These are used throughout this demo, and the <a href="/docs/example-api-doc/">Example API Doc</a> offers a complete demonstration.
